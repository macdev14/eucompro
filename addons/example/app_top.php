 * and enabled.
 *
 * If this file exists, it will get included AFTER the database and addon system
 * is initialized, but BEFORE any of the main application is loaded  (It is loaded
 * in the file app_top.common.php).
 *
 * This file will only be included if the addon is enabled.  This behavior has changed
 * since previous versions.
 *
 * This file should rarely be used in an addon.  It is only for special cases that require
 * something be done before the rest of the application loads up.
 *
 * It is up to you to ensure that no conflicting app_top files from other addons
 * have already been included.
