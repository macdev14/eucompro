/**
 * Optional file, file name can be anything. The cron task name
 * will be addon_name:file_name
 *
 * See contents of function {@link addon_example_setup::install()} for example of how
 * to add this task to the cron job heartbeat schedule.  Without adding this task
 * using {@link geoCron::set()} the task will not be able to be run from the cron system.
 *
 * This file will be included when the task is scheduled to run, and is expected
 * to return true if the task completed, or false if not.  If the file returns
 * false (or nothing), the last_run timestamp for this task will not be updated,
 * so the task will be run again on the next heartbeat (unless interval
 * is -1, which means the task will only run by calling it manually using a cron job)
 *
 * For example cron tasks, see the files in the folder "classes/cron/".
 *
 * When the task is run, this file is included inside of {@link geoCron::run()}, and will
 * be able to access any of the already initialized class vars, which are:
 * - $this->db - database object
 * - $this->session - session object
 * - $this->product_configuration - geoPC object
 * - $this->addon - addon object
 * - $this->verbose - boolean, if true, expecting to echo out information.
 *
 * See the {@link geoCron} class for more information.
