# Example Addon

/**
 * This file is empty, there is currently no example seller to buyer example
 * or documentation, for now see the paypal seller to buyer gateway to see
 * how things work:
 *
 * classes/payment_gateways/seller_buyer/paypal.php
 *
 * To be clear, you CAN create a seller to buyer payment gateway inside of an
 * addon, by creating a payment_gateways/seller_buyer/ directory, and placing
 * your custom seller to buyer payment gateway in that directory.
 *
 * This file, by default, starts with an underscore, because when the system
 * is parsing addon's directories, it will skip over any
 * files that start with an underscore.
