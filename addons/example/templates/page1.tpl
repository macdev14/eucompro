Note to template designers:
	You can over-ride an addon's smarty template by placing
	an identically named template file in your template set,
	under addons/ in a sub-directory named the same as the folder
	name for the addon.
	For example, to over-ride this template, you would create
	a file at:
	my_template_set/addons/example/page1.tpl

<h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
<p>This is an example of how to use an addon to replace the main_body.  This page's main body tag was replaced by the example addon.</p>
