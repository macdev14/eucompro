These settings are for features that <strong>may not be fully functional</strong>
yet, but are implemented in the software. Please read these notes about settings found in this section:
<ol>
	<li>Most of these settings are here because they are not fully tested yet,
		but we wanted to make them available to you as a client.  A few of these
		settings are here because we have not decided whether to make them part
		of the main application	or not.  These settings are only available to Enterprise level
		products.</li>
	<li>Any beta settings (or features turned on by these settings) are subject to be changed
		drastically, or even removed in future versions.</li>
	<li><strong>These settings are BETA.</strong>  Changing them might have unexpected consequences,
		and might even break parts of your site.  We welcome feedback and bug reports
		on these features, and will try to help you fix your site if something
		does break, but you must be prepared to restore from a back-up if it comes to that.</li>
	<li>Always take the proper precautions when changing these
		settings.  Back up your database and files regularly.  If on a live site with
		heavy traffic, test the changes on a test site first.</li>
</ol>
<strong>DO NOT CHANGE these settings unless you are willing to use as Beta</strong>.<br><br>
To turn a setting to off, enter the text OFF or leave the field blank.  No input checking is done, it is up to you to make sure you enter the value as specified by the description.<br><br>';
