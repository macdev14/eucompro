/**
 * This is a "developer template" that documents most, if not all, of what an
 * order item can do in the system.
 *
 * @package System
 * @since Version 4.0.0
 */



/**
 * Developers: use this file as a template to create a new order item.
 *
 * If this is a 3rd party order item,
 * note that you can have order items inside of addons.  See the examle addon, in the folder
 * order_items in that addon.<br />
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1.  Rename the file to something that does not start with an underscore, all files that start
 *     with an underscore are ignored by the order item system.  Pick something that will be unique
 *     to whatever the order item is, to prevent name collisions.
 * 2.  Rename the class name (below) to match the filename.  For instance, if the filename is
 *     my_order_item.php, the class name needs to be my_order_itemOrderItem.  Make sure you keep it
 *     so that it still extends the geoOrderItem class.
 * 3.  Change the class variable $type to match the filename, for instance if the filename is
 *     my_order_item.php, the line should read:<br />
 *     protected $type = "my_order_item";
 * 4.  Change the class var $defaultProcessOrder to be a number that represents the order it will be
 *     processed, and order it will be displayed in various places.  This is important, for instance
 *     if the defaultProcessOrder is higher than the defaultProcessOrder of the tax item, this item will not be
 *     used when calculating tax, and it will appear below the tax item when viewing the cart.  It should normally
 *     need to be something below 1000 for any "normal" order items.
 * 5.  Implement each of the template functions below that will be used by this order item, and delete
 *     or comment out the functions that you know you will not need to use and that are marked as
 *     optional.  Make sure you keep the required functions however (read the comments on each
 *     function).  As a way to keep track of what you have finished, as you go once you have
 *     implemented a function, remove the TODO comment at the top of the function.
 * 6.  Only functions that are not implemented by the parent class geoOrderItem are in this template,
 *     but you are not limited to those functions, if you wish you can over-write any of the functions
 *     already implemented in geoOrderItem, for instance if you wanted to change the behavior of getCost().
 *
 *  Note: If a method is defined as static, that means it will be called statically by the
 *  system, so keep this in mind when implimenting each method.
 *
 * @package System
 * @since Version 4.0.0

     *
     * CheckVars / Process Methods
     * ===========================
     *
     * When the process gets to the step _template:details, if $_REQUEST['process'] is
     * defined, then it will make the following static method calls:
     *
     *     _template::<STEP_NAME>CheckVars(); - if return true, then:
     *     _template::<STEP_NAME>Process(); - if return true, then it will continue on to next step

     * Display Method
     * ==============

     * That display function is responsible for displaying the page, then including app_bottom.php,
     * then exiting.  If it does not exit, the system will display a site error.
     *
     * Step Label
     * ==========
     *
     * If the below optional method exists, it will also call that method to determine the "label"
     * for the step, to be displayed in templates that show the progress.  The method below
     * should return a string to display as the name of the step, or an empty string if you
     * wish to hide the step from the user:
     *
     *     _template::<STEP_NAME>Label();

     *   for whether auctions is turned on.  If this is true, this is being
