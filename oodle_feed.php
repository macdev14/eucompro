 * make a change to only 1 setting, you only have to put the setting you want

 *
 * In other words, instead of making oodle setting changes directly to the
 * file, this gives you the option to make changes in a seperate "config" file
 * instead, that will not be over-written when you update the software.
 *
 * To do so, create the file "oodle_feed.config.php" (or named how you want)
 * and copy/paste the first part of this file, up until the "END SETTINGS" line.
 *
 * Examples:
 * detect - let the script detect what the config filename is, which will be
 *          the same as this filename, but with .php replaced with .config.php
 * my_oodle_config.php - use the file named "my_oodle_config.php" for the file name.

###  Advanced Controls  ###
# The controls demonstrated below are more for PHP developers, to give them
# more control over what listings are displayed, without having
# to edit things below the "do not edit below this line" line.

/**
 * This is an example of how to add further "filter" criteria.  To use, you would
 * "un-comment" the following line by removing the # in front of it.  This will
 * add an additional "where field_name = 'field value'" to the SQL query that gets
 * the listings, so it lets you get fancy with things.  Remember, certain fields are
 * "url encoded", so keep that in mind when creating custom where clauses.
 *
 * If you need to have more control over the SQL query than just adding an
 * additional "where clause", you can get the geoTableSelect object by calling:
 *
 * $query = $feed->getTableSelect();
 *
 * Use it's methods to alter the query used when listings are retrieved.  See
 * the docs on geoTableSelect class for more info on what can be done.
